# Null Movement Script for AutoHotkey v2 ( CS2 )
First code credit to Qiasfah on Github
- An attempt to recreate some of the features built into the newer keyboards, no idea about how to try and do hardware level actuation and the rapid fire, I wouldnt even like to try to run a rapid fire script in any sort of VAC server just incase however if its a keyboard it's allowed... anyway;
